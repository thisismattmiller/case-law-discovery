<br><br><br>This site is a demo of a discovery environment using enriched metadata. 40 Thousand Illinois Supreme Court case law opinions were added from the <a href="http://lil.law.harvard.edu/projects/caselaw-access-project/">Caselaw Access Project</a>. The focus is not of full text search but the facets added via LOD enrichment for the authors of the opinions. These facets were created by using the metadata for each judge found on Wikidata. In addition the opinions were ran through Stanford NLP Named Entity tool, that data (which can be further enriched by reconciling them to Wikidata) are in NER Locations and NER Organizations.<br>
